    <!-- Main table for tasks
      Use model-view binding to render the rows fo this table
      based on the models in the given collection. "dataCollection"
      represents the collection used to populate this table.

      models processed within the collection. "dataTransform"
      is a function that will be executed on each model as it
      is rendered as a row. It gives the opportunity to modify
      the model's values before they are applied to each row.
